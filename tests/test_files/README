This directory is maint contain various test files.

Only the crasher directory should contain actual files on the public repository, as they are from the free libpng software (but may have been modified).
Other test images has been scraped from the internet and will not be distributed here.
The libpng license may be found in the appropriate directory (/tests/testfiles/crashers).

The test process has been automated in /tests/tester.py, to perform some test, one may add png files to the 'new' directory,
and run '../tester.py masstest'. This will move any file from the 'error' and 'fine' directorys to the 'new' directory,
and then test each file individually and place it back in the appropriate directory.
'../tester.py stats' may also be used, it will perform the same operation, but will gather statistics about the files, and will take much longer to run.

TODO: As of commit 3e591597b5654812f4ec7fdc0938c6d95a36c3b3, this is all work in progress.
